    "**O**bject **N**otation or **JSON** data structure that you learned about in the introductory\n",
    "lesson in this module. JSON is an ideal format for larger data that have a hierarchical structured relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python`, `JSON` data is similar to a dictonary because it has keys (i.e. names) and values, but it is encoded as a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Python` library `json` is helpful to convert data from lists or dictonaries into `JSON` strings and `JSON` strings into lists or dictonaries. `Pandas` can also be used to convert `JSON` data (via a `Python` dictionary) into a `Pandas` `DataFrame`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a `JSON` object is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data are in name/value pairs using colons `:`.\n",
    "* Data **objects** are separated by commas.\n",
    "* Curly braces `{}` hold the objects.\n",
    "* Square brackets `[]` can be used to indicate an **array** that contains a group of objects.\n",
    "* Each **data element** is enclosed with quotes `\"\"` if it is a character, or without quotes if it is a numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a name/value pair using a colon:\n",
    "```json\n",
    " { \"name\":\"Chaya\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of objects separated by commas:  \n",
    "```json\n",
    "{ \"name\":\"Chaya\", \"age\":12, \"city\":\"Boulder\", \"type\":\"Canine\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the data above are structured. Thus, each element contains a particular object name (name, age, city, etc) and values are associated with these names. This is similar to column headings in a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the `JSON` structure can also be nested using square brackets to indicate an array that contains a group of objects, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"students\":[\n",
    "    { \"firstName\":\"Serena\", \"lastName\":\"Williams\" },\n",
    "    { \"firstName\":\"Boe\", \"lastName\":\"Diddly\" },\n",
    "    { \"firstName\":\"Al\", \"lastName\":\"Gore\" }\n",
    "]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to store nested or **hierarchical** data within a text file structure makes `JSON` a powerful format to use as you are working with larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Data Tip:** The GeoJSON\n",
    "data structure is a powerful data structure that supports spatial data. GeoJSON\n",
    "can be used to create maps just like shapefiles can. This format is often used\n",
    "for web mapping applications like Leaflet (which you will learn about later in\n",
    "this module).\n",

    "* booleans (TRUE / FALSE)\n",
    "* null\n",
    "\n",
