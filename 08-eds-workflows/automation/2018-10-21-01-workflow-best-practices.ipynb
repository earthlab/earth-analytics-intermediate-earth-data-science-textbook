    "## Data Workflow Best Practices \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lessons, you designed a workflow to process several sites worth of Landsat data, but of course, identifying the workflow is just beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the steps you identified in your pseudocode, you need to flesh out how you can accomplish each task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you design your workflow in more detail, there are many things to keep in mind regarding how you will use and name files, how you will modularize code to reduce repetitive code, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the data workflow best practices discussed below. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Do Not Modify the Raw Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically you do not want to modify the raw data, so that you can always reproduce your output from the same inputs. In some cases, this is less important, e.g., when you are not tasked with curating the raw data. For example you *could*  redownload the landsat data provided in this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, this is extremely important - you wouldn’t want to recollect a summers worth of field collected data because you accidentally modified the original spreadsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is to create an “outputs” directory where you store outputs. An outputs directory is helpful because:\n",
    "1. You can always delete and recreate the outputs without worrying about deleting your original data.\n",
    "2. An outputs directory is expressive and reminds anyone looking at your project (including you in the future - i.e. your future self!) where the output products are - they don’t have to dig for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Expressive Intermediate File Names and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to carefully consider how you name your intermediate and end product outputs so that the names reflect your intention and the content. For instance - in this case you are creating an NDVI dataframe which would be exported to a csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some naming options:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Less than ideal name\n",
    "data.csv\n",
    "# OK Name\n",
    "ndvi.csv\n",
    "# More expressive name\n",
    "all-sites-ndvi.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use clear, expressive names for objects, files, etc. Ask yourself if someone reading your code could guess what is contained in that object or file based on the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write Modular Code \n",
    "\n",
    "As you are working on your pseudo code, consider the parts of your analysis that are well suited for functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing custom functions for repetitive tasks in your workflows can help your workflow to be more efficient and easier to follow and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, a Python function will have 1-3 inputs and will produce 1-2 outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep functions small and focused. A function should do one thing well. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can then combine many functions into a wrapper function to automate and make for a nicely crafted program."
