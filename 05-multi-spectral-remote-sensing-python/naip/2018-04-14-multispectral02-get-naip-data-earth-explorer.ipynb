    "\n",
    "When searching for data, the first thing that you need to do is to define your\n",
    "area of interest (AOI). Your AOI for this week, is defined by the boundary of the Cold Springs fire extent. You could type in the x,y vertices of each corner of the boundary,\n",
    "but if you have an Earth Explorer account, you can upload a ZIPPED up shapefile that\n",
    "contains the boundary instead.\n",

    "To define your AOI in Earth Explorer:\n",
