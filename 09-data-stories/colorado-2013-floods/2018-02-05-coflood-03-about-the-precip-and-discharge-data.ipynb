    "The USGS has a distributed network of aquatic sensors located in streams across the United States. This network monitors a suit of variables that are important to stream morphology and health. One of the metrics that this sensor network monitors is **Stream Discharge**, a metric which quantifies the volume of water moving down a stream. Discharge is an ideal metric to quantify flow, which increases significantly during a flood event.\n",

    "> As defined by USGS: Discharge is the volume of water moving down a stream or\n",
    "> river per unit of time, commonly expressed in cubic feet per second or gallons\n",
    "> per day. In general, river discharge is computed by multiplying the area of\n",
