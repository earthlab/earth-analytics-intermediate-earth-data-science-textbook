    "## Use Remote Sensing Data to Understand Fire Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing data are often used to study fires. Remote sensing data, collected from satellites and airplanes, allow you to gather information about the landscape over time. Data collected from satellites like Landsat and MODIS are freely available and collected regularly across the globe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since remote sensing data are collected over time, they can be used to, among other things:\n",
    "* Track changes in vegetation.\n",
    "* Understand the area and intensity of fires.\n",
    "* Monitor the post-fire vegetation dynamics of burned areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote Sensing Derived Vegetation Indices to Understand Fire Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vegetation indices** can be useful tools for quantifying and visualizing the before and after effects of wildfire. They are calculations performed on specific spectral bands of remotely sensed imagery to accentuate a particular vegetation characteristic. They can be used for anything from understanding disasters like floods or fires to deciding when to irrigate crops. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a vegetation index, you will need access to specific imagery bands across the electromagnetic spectrum; in other words, you will need access to satellite imagery with a certain <a href=\"{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/\">spectral resolution.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/vegetation-indices-in-python/\">The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)</a> is a vegetation index that is used to measure the greenness of the area. For the purpose of studying wildfires like the Cold Springs Fire, it allows you to visualize and quantify vegetation health before and after the fire. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, you can use NDVI to track the rate of vegetation growing back in a burned area over time. This can tell you the speed of ecosystem recovery. In this course, you will learn how to calculate NDVI and create images like those below using Python.\n",

    "<a href=\"{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/vegetation-indices-in-python/\">The normalized burn ratio (NBR)</a> is another vegetation index that allows you to visualize burned areas to understand fire severity. To use NBR to understand wildfire, you can perform the calculation on a remotely sensed image taken prior to the fire and on another taken after, and then calculate the difference between the two. \n",
