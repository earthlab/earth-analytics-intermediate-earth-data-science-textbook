    "## What are HDF4 Files?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the landing page of this section, you learned about the general characteristics of Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files and that there are many types of HDF files including HDF4, HDF5, and NetCDF. HDF files are open source file formats that support large, complex, heterogeneous data, using a \"file directory\" like structure. HDF formats also allow for embedding of metadata, making them *self-describing*. \n",
    "\n",
    "HDF4 is an older hierarchical data format as compared to HDF5, which is the latest version promoted by the HDF Group, the publisher of the libraries and standards for these formats. While the transition to HDF5 has occurred for many remote sensing products, HDF4 is still the primary data format that is adapted for MODIS data products published by NASA.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i> **Data Tip:** HDF4 is an older hierarchical data format. Most MODIS data are still delivered in an adapted version of this format. HDF5 (and NetCDF which is similar to the HDF5 format with different associated standards) are the preferred data structures to use for new data products.\n",
    "{: .notice--success}\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on HDF4, review the <a href=\"https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF4/HDF4\" target=\"_blank\">HDF4 User Guide</a> and learn more about the <a href=\"https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5_tools/h4toh5/h4vsh5.html\" target=\"_blank\">differences between the HDF4 and HDF5 formats</a>. \n",

    "## HDF4 EOS Format for MODIS\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the HDF4 and HDF5 formats have been adapted by NASA to publish data from Earth Observing System (EOS) missions. These adapted formats, referred to as <a href=\"http://www.hdfeos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HDF-EOS</a>, contain additional geolocated data types (point, grid, swath) that can be used to store spatial information that are not supported within the original HDF structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "HDF4-EOS, the format adapted from HDF4, is the currently used format for MODIS data products. You can review the <a href=\"https://observer.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/edhs/hdfeos/latest_release/HDF-EOS_UG.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">HDF4-EOS User Guide (section 3.1)</a> to learn more about how the HDF4 format has been adapted to support these additional spatial data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "HDF4-EOS files are composed of a directory containing data objects (what we might think of as individual files in a computer directory). Each data object is listed as an individual entry in the directory, which allows the data object to be linked with related metadata. \n",
    "\n",
