The appropriately named Aqua and Terra satellites both focus their data collection on their area of specialty, water and land respectively. For land based earth analytics projects, such as calculating NDVI or NBR, you should generally be getting your data from the Terra satellite, as it is the one that focuses on land based data collection."

Note that it is much easier to use the pre-processed data such as surface reflectance, and not the more raw data like the raw radiance product.

So if you want land based data, you would be looking to choose a product that begins with `MO`.\n",

You can also find more data on each product on the <a href=\"https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod09.php\" target=\"_blank\">MODIS website</a>. MODIS products can vary widly. MODIS makes a complete pass of the Earth daily. Some products are created daily based on the individual readings for the day, and others are weekly averages of an area, to help account for cloud cover or other interference that can occur from day to day. Some products are even yearly, such as the MODIS land cover product, which is a composite of an entire year's worth of data. \n",

    "\n",
    "For surface reflection, there are also averages that are collected over 8 days, such as `MOD09A1`. An advantage of this data over the daily data is that since it's a week long average, it allows for some layers of the data, such as the `Surface reflectance 500m state flags` QC layer, to be higher resolution than the daily products.

    "\n",
    "When searching for data, the first thing that you need to do is to define your\n",
    "area of interest (AOI). You could type in the x,y vertices of each corner of a boundary,\n",
