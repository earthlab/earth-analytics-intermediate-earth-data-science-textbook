    "\n",
    "* Connect to the twitter RESTful API to access twitter data with `Python`.\n",
    "* Generate custom queries that download tweet data into `Python` using `Tweepy`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Set up a Twitter account if you don't have one already.\n",

    "3. Import the `tweepy` package.\n",

    "Once you've done these things, you are ready to begin querying Twitter's API to see what you can learn about tweets!\n",

    "## Set up Twitter App \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have applied for <a href = \"https://apps.twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Developer Access</a>, you can create an application in Twitter that you can use to access tweets. Make sure you already have a Twitter account. \n",
